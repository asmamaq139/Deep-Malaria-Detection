# Deep-Malaria-Detection

- Dataset: Dataset contains 27, 558 cell images collected from 150 malaria infected patients and 50 healthy patients. Dataset is balanced with 13, 779 infected and uninfected images. Due to different bloodstains present in the images of the cells during the data acquisition process, color distributions of images are versatile.
- NIH	Malaria	Dataset	is publically Available: https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932

- CNN:  Convolutional neural networks require fewer weights and fewer neurons since neurons in each layer are not fully connected to those in the previous layer. Because of this, CNNs perform much better on image classification tasks than a fully connected neural network. Convolutional layers and pooling layers are two important layers of the CNN architecture. A convolutional layer extracts feature maps from images by performing convolution operation and pooling layer down-samples them to reduce the size of feature maps. CNN learns spatial patterns and variety of features hidden in images and results of CNN are translation invariant. 

- Results: Malaria detection using CNN achieves 97% accuracy
